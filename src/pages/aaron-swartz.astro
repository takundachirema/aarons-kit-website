		<h1 style="text-align:center;">A fallen hero, Aaron Swartz </h1>
		<h3 style="text-align:center;">	Celebrating the life of “the internet’s own boy”</h3>
	</TextSection>
	<TextSection>
		<p style="text-align:justify" class="margin-p"> 
			At age 26, Aaron Swartz tragically took his own life. He had been unfairly and 
			shamefully prosecuted and charged with 13 criminal counts for downloading millions 
			of articles from an online journal library, called JSTOR, on MIT’s network.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify" class="margin-p"> 	
			In his “Guerilla Open Access Manifesto”, Aaron wrote: “There is no justice in following 
			unjust laws”. And it was exactly because of an unjust law that prosecutors were 
			allowed to seek a maximum sentence of 35 years in prison and a fine of $1 million 
			against Swartz.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify" class="margin-p">
			Without Aaron Swartz, the internet would not have existed in its current form. Aaron 
			devoted his whole life to upholding the civil rights that serve as the foundation of 
			our modern civilisation. Let's go back in time to examine the life and accomplishments of the young internet 
			pioneer and "hactivist," a boy who had the potential to transform the world.

					<p style="text-align:justify" class="astro-426S6YDN margin-p">				
						At age 12, Aaron created the Info Network, a user-generated encyclopedia. 
						It was an unintentional clone of Wikipedia, before Wikipedia existed. Aaron 
						went on to win the 2000 ArsDigita Prize for his website.
						
					</p>

					<h3 class="astro-426S6YDN margin-p">2000: RSS 1.0</h3>
					<p style="text-align:justify" class="astro-426S6YDN margin-p">
						Aaron became part of the working group that pioneered RSS (Really Simple Syndication), 
						a web feed that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a 
						standardised, computer readable format. At the time, Aaron was 14 years old.
					</p>

					<h3 class="astro-426S6YDN margin-p">2002: Creative Commons</h3>
					<p style="text-align:justify" class="astro-426S6YDN margin-p">				
						As a teenager, Aaron became one of the early architects of <a href="https://creativecommons.org/" class="astro-426S6YDN" target="_blank">Creative Commons (CC)</a> when 
						he helped design the code layer to their licences. CC is a non-profit organisation with 
						a global presence that offers free licences for creators to utilise when making their 
						work accessible to the general public. These licences make it easier for the creator 
						to grant upfront authorisation for others to utilise the work under specific conditions. 
						Aaron, later in life, was instrumental in creating the movement that helped CC achieve 
						enormous success, as he helped advocate for a free and open internet.

					<p style="text-align:justify" class="astro-426S6YDN margin-p">				
						Aaron founded Infogami, a flexible content management system intended to produce rich and
						aesthetically appealing websites during his freshman year at Stanford University. This project 
						was funded by Y Combinator's first Summer Founders Program. Despite Infogami's lack of success, 
						Aaron went on to merge it with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/" class="astro-426S6YDN" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, a now widely used social news aggregation website, earning 
						him the distinction of Reddit co-founder. Aaron and his co-founders sold the company to Conde Nast 
						just a year later for $10 million. The company is valued at $10 billion today.

					<h3 class="astro-Y37P3WSM margin-p" margin-p>2006: The Open Library</h3>
					<p style="text-align:justify" class="astro-Y37P3WSM margin-p">
						Imagine a day in the future when you are not sent to Amazon when you search for a book online. 
						<a href="https://openlibrary.org/" class="astro-Y37P3WSM" target="_blank">The Open Library</a>, a website with the goal of creating one 
						location for every book ever written, attempts to accomplish just that. With the help of four 
						other founders, Aaron launched this initiative, which is still active today.
					</p>

					<h3 class="astro-Y37P3WSM margin-p">2008: PACER download</h3>
					<p style="text-align:justify" class="astro-Y37P3WSM margin-p">				
						Aaron downloaded an estimated 2.8 million federal court documents from the PACER (Public Access to 
						Court Electronic Records) database. At the time, users had to pay 8 cents per page accessed through 
						PACER. Carl Malamud, who founded the nonprofit group <a href="https://public.resource.org/" class="astro-Y37P3WSM" target="_blank">Public.Resource.Org</a> 
						contended that these documents should be free, because federal documents are not covered by copyright. 
						He called for members of the public to upload their already paid for documents to the website to provide 
						free access to all. Aaron answered his call and used a Perl computer script running on Amazon cloud 
						servers to download the documents, using credentials belonging to a Sacramento library which offered 
						free access to the PACER database.
					</p>

					<h3 class="astro-Y37P3WSM margin-p">2010: JSTOR download</h3>
					<p style="text-align:justify" class="astro-Y37P3WSM margin-p">				
						On September 25, 2010, Aaron Swartz used MIT guest login credentials and began sending hundreds of PDF 
						download requests per minute to the JSTOR website, enough to slow the site's performance. Aaron connected 
						his laptop to a networking switch in a controlled-access wiring closet at MIT. In the end, Aaron managed 
						to download over 4 million PDF files, which he stored on a personal hard drive. Aaron was caught, and was 
						indicted in a Boston court. According to the prosecution, the data were obtained with the intention of 
						being distributed for free on P2P sharing websites.
					</p>

					<h3 class="astro-Y37P3WSM margin-p">2010: SOPA</h3>
					<p style="text-align:justify" class="astro-Y37P3WSM margin-p">				
						Aaron established the online movement Demand Progress, which successfully lobbied against the SOPA and PIPA 
						proposals that would have censored the Internet. Although SOPA was designed to prevent Internet copyright 
						infringement, it received harsh criticism because it would make it simpler for the US government to take down 
						websites that were allegedly infringing on copyright and because it would put an unbearable load on Internet 
						service providers. Additionally, because the internet would no longer be free from censorship if this bill 
						had been implemented, it would have violated civil rights to freedom of expression and communication.
